The pack contains a Substance file (.SBSAR), which lets you export texture in the resolution of your choice, from 512 px to 8K, depending on your machine's capabilities.

The included Substance (.SBSAR) file allows you to tweak multiple parameters to suit your needs:
• Adjust wood color (HUE, contrast, brightness)
• Modify wood grain variations (translation, rotation)
• Control roughness and height details
• Customize relief and normal map intensity

To use these options and export your textures, you'll need Substance 3D Player, a free software provided by Adobe.

Once installed, open the .SBSAR file in the software, adjust the settings as required, choose the desired resolution, and export the textures in the format that suits you.
